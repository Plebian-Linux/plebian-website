<h1>First Boot</h1>
<p>
    There are three ways of interfacing with your board: over serial, with a
    keyboard and monitor, and over the network.
</p>
<p>
    The preferred method is to interact with it on its first boot through
    serial, just because it's the method through which you'll be most likely to
    debug any early boot failures. However, any of the other two methods should
    work in the best case as well, and are usually easier to set up.
</p>
<h2>Methods Of Interacting With The Board</h2>
<h3>Interacting Through Serial</h3>
<p>
    To get a serial connection to the board, you'll need a 1.5 megabauds capable
    3.3V serial adapter, such as the PINE64 Woodpecker.
</p>
<p>
    Connect GND of the serial adapter to a ground pin of your board. Then,
    connect the TXD pin of the serial adapter to the RXD pin of the board
    (pin 10), and the RXD pin of the serial adapter to the TXD pin of the board
    (pin 8). If this doesn't work, try swapping TXD and RXD around, sometimes
    the labelling is reversed.
</p>
<p>
    Plug the USB to Serial adapter into your computer, and open a serial
    terminal at 1500000n1. On linux you can do it like this with picocom:<br>
    <code class="plebian-command">picocom -b 1500000 /dev/ttyUSB0</code>
</p>
<p>
    On Windows, you can use a serial terminal like PuTTY.
</p>
<h3>Interacting Through Monitor &amp; Keyboard</h3>
<p>
    To interact with your board through monitor and keyboard, just connect a
    normal USB keyboard to the board's USB ports and a monitor capable of
    displaying a 1920x1080@60Hz (or 1280x720@60Hz) signal.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that you will not see messages from u-boot this way, the video
    output only becomes functional once the Linux kernel is started and sets a
    video mode.
</p>
<h3>Interacting Through Network</h3>
<p>
    The board will grab an IP through DHCP on any available wired network
    adapter and start an OpenSSH daemon on port 22 (the default). It'll also
    announce itself over mDNS.
</p>
<p>
    This means connecting to the board is as simple as plugging in a network
    cable and ssh'ing to pleb@<var>hostname</var>.local, where
    <var>hostname</var> depends on your board and is one of the following
    choices:
    <ul>
        <li>plebian-quartz64a</li>
        <li>plebian-quartz64b</li>
        <li>plebian-soquartz-blade</li>
        <li>plebian-soquartz-model-a</li>
        <li>plebian-soquartz-cm4</li>
    </ul>
    This requires your system to support resolving domain names through mDNS,
    e.g. with Avahi or systemd-resolved.
</p>
<p>
    Alternatively, you can connect to the board's IP directly, though you'll
    need to find said IP yourself.
